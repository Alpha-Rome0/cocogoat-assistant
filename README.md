# Cocogoat Assistant 🥥 🌴
Hi! You can just call me Cocogoat. I'm an assistant with tools and scripts to assist in the Genshin Impact grind. As per our contract.˚ ༘♡ ⋆｡˚

## Current Abilities:
- I can automatically check-in to the Hoyolab website and collect rewards for you at a random time each day. This can either be ran in the background locally or by using a GitHub workflow. 

## Setup:
Option 1: Fork the repo and add LTUID and LTOKEN as repo secrets and run the GitHub workflow automatically every 24 hours.
Option 2: Clone or download the repo locally and run main.py manually. Before you do this, update config.json with the browser
that you normally use to login to Hoyolab and set "use_workflow" to "false". The current browsers supported are: Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge, Chromium, Brave, and Vivaldi. If you use something other than that, I would recommend using Option 1.

## What I Want to Learn:
- Fishing in Teyvat
- Cooking delicious food to keep up team morale ( ˘▽˘)っ🍜
- Calculate resin regeneration
- Tracking weapon and character ascension materials
- Keep track of wishes and calculate your current pity

## Feedback:
Please feel free to open an issue if you think there is an area I can improve upon. I remember reading in an ancient text that "Only when days be darker than the darkest night, may a qilin be compelled to fight." That's a massive exaggeration... But should the time come for battle, and should you need me, then I will give it every ounce of my strength. 💪(=⌒‿‿⌒=)
